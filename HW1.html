<h1>A list of my top 5 favourite movies! </h1>
<hr />

<h2> 1. The Godfather Part 2</h2>
<p>This is the second entry to the Brilliant Francis Ford Coppola's cinematic magnum opus known as The Godfather Trilogy. It stars 
    The legendary actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and Robert De Niro. It is widely acclaimed as one of if not the best on-screen
    portrayals of the Italian American mob in cinema, as well as one of the most critically acclaimed films in history.
</p>
<h2> 2. Scott Pilgrim vs The World</h2>
<p>Directed by Edgar Wright, starring Michael Cera and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, I would describe this movie as pure fun. If a videogame 
    was a movie, this would be it. It's about the title character Scott and his quest to win the heart of the new girl in town Ramona, as he battles 
    her leaugue of 7 evil exes, which he must defeat to date her. This movie encapsulates the conflicts one endures as a young adult trying to find love and the challenges that come with it, while still maintaning a constant pace of upbeat action sequences 
    and great comedic timing. 
</p>
<h2> 3. Midnight in Paris</h2>
<p>This is a heartwarming movie directd by Woody Allen, starring household names Owen Wilson and Rachel McAdams. It is about an author 
    currently unhappy in his life, career, and relationship, consumed with nostalgia, and with dreams of standing amongst his literary heroes...a dream which comes
    true in a strange way while on vacation with his fiance. Despite the somber unerlying tone, I really enjoyed the dialogue, message, and comedy of the movie.
</p>
<h2> 4. Before Trilogy (Sunrise, Sunset, Midnight)</h2>
<p>As someone who typically doesn't enjoy the rom-com format, I have to say that this particular movie blew my mind. 
    With long yet continuously engaging dialogue filmed over a single take, this Richard Linklater series of movies follows the relationship
    and growth of two strangers, incredibly played by Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, falling in and out of love over decades. 
</p>
<h2> 5. Inception</h2>
<p>While known for his signature plot twists, I believe that this movie cemented Christopher Nolan's legacy as a director ability to interweave 
    grandious cinematic sequences with the most mind-boggling and intricate concepts imaginable. Starring the sensational Leonardo DiCaprio
    it follows a group of mind thieves attempting to steal a valuable piece of information from within other people's dreams, where all logic is thrown out the 
    window, making opportunites of physics defying stunts and sequences.
